Although they can use their abilities on any plant, the greenseer has an affinity for one particular type which determines a unique aspect of their appearance",

A greenseer focused on enjoying the splendor of wildflowers might possess an affinity for mountain irises, with several purple blooms always on their shoulders. A more melancholic greenseer may have an affinity for willows, giving their hair a ropey, drooping appearance. A greenseer rooted to ideals of community might develop bark-like skin, with designs similar to aspen trees that tend to grow in close-knit clusters.",
