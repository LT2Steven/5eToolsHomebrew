							"While the faenorn is bound to the Feywild, it is usually restricted to a 50-mile-radius centering on a landmark or geographical feature, such as a particular forest or mountain. Within that radius, it can move freely or use its projections. The regional effects only occur within a 1-mile-radius of the faenornâ€™s current location. Its lair can be any location that it prefers, such as a cave, a grove, or a crypt.",
