Each lodge has its own personality, expressed by their fighting styles and appearance. Lodge are protected by their own telthor, usually of a creature related to the lodge's name. The members of each lodge are grouped into \"Fangs,\" elite fighting forces ready to answer the Iron Lord's call to defend the nation. Initiation rites vary by lodge but invariably require a demonstration of fighting prowess and completion of various tests such as all-night drinking contests or single handed battle against every member of the lodge.

				"Witchboats are a common sight on the waterways of Rashemen. They are typically small wooden boats that can hold three to four people (as per a rowboat), though larger warboats (equivalent to longships) are known to exist as well. These boats are crafted by Rashemani spellcasters who call upon the spirits of the land to enchant the watercraft. No working versions of these vessels have been seen outside of Rashemen.",
				"If the witchboat is floating in a body of water, and you are within 5 feet of the vessel, you may speak the command word as a bonus action to cause the boat to perform one of the following:",
				"{@b Move.} The vessel moves at a rate of 30 feet per turn across water in any direction. This movement speed is unaffected by water currents.",
				"{@b Stop.} The vessel stops any movement and remains stationary regardless of current.",
				"{@b Return.} The vessel returns to its most recent previous location even if empty."
