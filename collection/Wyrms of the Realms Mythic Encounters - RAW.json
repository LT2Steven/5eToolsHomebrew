While this globe lingers, you are unable to use your action to trigger this spell again. When you create this globe, you must determine a circumstance that will trigger the globe to detonate. the triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the globe. For example, you could instruct the globe to detonate when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it. The base damage of the globe is {@dice 6d6}. If at the end of your turn the globe has not yet detonated, the damage increases by {@dice 1d6}. If the globe is touched before the spell ends (and it has not yet triggered), the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the  globe to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can  push the globe up to 20 feet. If it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the globe explodes.",
